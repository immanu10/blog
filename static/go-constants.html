<h1>Go Constants</h1>
<br>
<div id="blog-content"><p>Constants in Go represent immutable values determined at compile time.  They can be of various basic types like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, and booleans.  Unlike variables, constants cannot be changed after they are declared.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import &quot;fmt&quot;

const (
	Pi       = 3.14159
	Language = &quot;Go&quot;
	Truth    = true
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(&quot;Value of Pi:&quot;, Pi)
	fmt.Println(&quot;Language:&quot;, Language)
	fmt.Println(&quot;Is it true?&quot;, Truth)

	// The following line would result in a compile-time error
	// because you cannot modify a constant:
	// Pi = 3.14

	// Typed constants
	const typedInt int = 10
	fmt.Println(&quot;Typed constant:&quot;, typedInt)


	// Untyped constants
	const untypedFloat = 20.5
	var float32Var float32 = float32(untypedFloat)
	var float64Var float64 = untypedFloat
	fmt.Println(&quot;Untyped constant as float32:&quot;, float32Var)
	fmt.Println(&quot;Untyped constant as float64:&quot;, float64Var)
}

</code></pre>

<p>This code snippet demonstrates a few key aspects of constants:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Declaration:</strong> Constants are declared using the <code>const</code> keyword.  You can group related constants together using parentheses.</li>
<li><strong>Naming Convention:</strong> Constant names typically follow the same rules as variable names, but with an uppercase first letter for exported constants (those accessible from other packages).</li>
<li><strong>Type Inference:</strong> Go can often infer the type of a constant based on its value, but you can explicitly specify the type if needed.  The examples include both typed (e.g., <code>typedInt</code>) and untyped constants (e.g., <code>untypedFloat</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Immutability:</strong> The commented-out line <code>Pi = 3.14</code> illustrates the fundamental principle that constants cannot be changed after they are declared.  Attempting to do so will lead to a compile-time error.</li>
<li><strong>Untyped Constants:</strong> Untyped constants take on the type of the context they are used in. This allows for flexible use in various situations, as shown with the <code>untypedFloat</code> example.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using constants makes your code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors by providing named values that won&rsquo;t accidentally be modified during program execution. They are particularly useful for defining values that have a special meaning or are used repeatedly throughout your code.</p>
