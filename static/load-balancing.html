<h1>Load Balancing</h1>
<br>
<div id="blog-content"><p>Load balancing is a core concept in system design that aims to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers. This distribution prevents any single server from becoming overloaded, ensuring high availability, responsiveness, and fault tolerance.  It&rsquo;s like having multiple cashiers at a grocery store instead of just one – the checkout lines move faster, and the system can handle more customers.</p>

<p>There are various load balancing algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Round Robin:</strong>  Distributes requests sequentially across servers. Simple to implement, but doesn&rsquo;t consider server load or capacity. Imagine dealing cards – each server gets one request in turn.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Least Connections:</strong> Directs traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.  This approach is more aware of server load and suitable for applications where requests have varying processing times.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Weighted Round Robin:</strong>  Similar to round robin, but assigns weights to each server, allowing for uneven distribution based on server capacity or other factors.  A more powerful server might get two requests for every one request a less powerful server receives.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>IP Hash:</strong> Uses the client&rsquo;s IP address to determine the server.  This ensures consistent server assignment for each client, beneficial for session persistence.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Least Response Time:</strong> Selects the server with the quickest average response time.  This dynamic approach considers server performance and network latency.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate a simple round-robin implementation in Go:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;net/http&quot;
    &quot;net/http/httputil&quot;
    &quot;net/url&quot;
)

var servers = []*url.URL{
    {Scheme: &quot;http&quot;, Host: &quot;server1:8080&quot;},
    {Scheme: &quot;http&quot;, Host: &quot;server2:8080&quot;},
    {Scheme: &quot;http&quot;, Host: &quot;server3:8080&quot;},
}

var currentServer = 0

func loadBalancer(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    server := servers[currentServer]
    proxy := httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(server)

    proxy.ServeHTTP(w, r)

    currentServer = (currentServer + 1) % len(servers)
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, loadBalancer)

    fmt.Println(&quot;Load balancer listening on :8000&quot;)
    http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:8000&quot;, nil)
}

</code></pre>

<p>This code snippet demonstrates a basic round-robin load balancer.  It cycles through a list of server URLs, directing each incoming request to the next server in line.  Real-world implementations are far more complex, incorporating health checks, connection pooling, and more sophisticated algorithms.</p>

<p>Load balancing is crucial for building scalable and resilient web applications. By distributing traffic effectively, it enhances performance, improves availability, and provides fault tolerance, enabling systems to handle increased demand and withstand server failures.</p>
