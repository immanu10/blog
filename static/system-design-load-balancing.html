<h1>System Design: Load Balancing</h1>
<br>
<div id="blog-content"><p>Load balancing is a critical component in designing scalable and reliable systems. It efficiently distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers (also known as a server pool or server farm). This prevents any single server from becoming overloaded, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and responsiveness for users.</p>

<p><strong>Why Use Load Balancing?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High Availability:</strong> If one server fails, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining healthy servers, preventing service interruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong>  Easily scale horizontally by adding more servers to the pool as demand increases. The load balancer automatically incorporates new servers into the traffic distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong>  Redundancy provided by multiple servers ensures that the system can continue operating even if some servers fail.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Distributing the load prevents any single server from being overwhelmed, resulting in faster response times and a better user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified Management:</strong>  Abstracts the complexity of managing multiple servers behind a single entry point.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How Load Balancing Works:</strong></p>

<p>A load balancer sits between the client and the server pool, intercepting incoming requests and distributing them across the available servers based on a chosen algorithm.  The client only interacts with the load balancer&rsquo;s IP address and is unaware of the individual servers behind it.</p>

<p><strong>Load Balancing Algorithms:</strong></p>

<p>Several algorithms determine how traffic is distributed. Here are a few common ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Round Robin:</strong> Distributes requests sequentially across servers. Simple and suitable for evenly distributed loads.</li>
<li><strong>Least Connections:</strong> Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections. Effective when server processing times vary.</li>
<li><strong>Weighted Round Robin:</strong> Assigns weights to servers, allowing for uneven distribution based on server capacity or other factors. Useful for heterogeneous server environments.</li>
<li><strong>IP Hash:</strong>  Uses the client&rsquo;s IP address to determine the server.  Ensures consistent server assignment for a given client.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example Scenario (Conceptual JavaScript):</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Conceptual representation - not actual load balancer code

const servers = [
  { address: 'server1.example.com', weight: 2 },
  { address: 'server2.example.com', weight: 1 },
  { address: 'server3.example.com', weight: 1 },
];

function weightedRoundRobin(servers) {
  let totalWeight = servers.reduce((sum, server) =&gt; sum + server.weight, 0);
  let currentWeight = 0;

  return function getNextServer() {
    let serverIndex = -1;
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; servers.length; i++) {
        currentWeight += servers[i].weight
        if(currentWeight &gt;= totalWeight){
          serverIndex = i;
          currentWeight = currentWeight % totalWeight
          break;
        }

    }

    // Handle cases where no servers are available
    return serverIndex === -1 ? null : servers[serverIndex].address;
  };

}


const getNext = weightedRoundRobin(servers);

console.log(getNext()); // server1.example.com
console.log(getNext()); // server1.example.com
console.log(getNext()); // server2.example.com
console.log(getNext()); // server3.example.com
console.log(getNext()); // server1.example.com
console.log(getNext()); // server1.example.com

<p><strong>Types of Load Balancers:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware Load Balancers:</strong> Dedicated physical devices offering high performance and advanced features.</li>
<li><strong>Software Load Balancers:</strong> Software solutions running on commodity hardware, providing greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness.  Examples include HAProxy, Nginx, and cloud-based load balancing services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Load balancing is a crucial aspect of building robust and scalable systems.  Understanding the different algorithms and types of load balancers allows you to choose the best solution for your specific needs.</p>
