<h1>Vim Jumps</h1>
<br>
<div id="blog-content"><p>Vim&rsquo;s jump list tracks your movements through a file, allowing you to quickly return to previously visited locations.  This is incredibly useful for navigating complex codebases or documents.</p>

<p>Think of the jump list as a breadcrumb trail of your editing journey. Every time you perform certain actions, Vim adds your current location to the list. These actions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using motions like <code>G</code>, <code>n</code>, <code>N</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>[[</code>, <code>]]</code>, <code>{</code>, <code>}</code>.</li>
<li>Deleting lines with <code>dd</code>.</li>
<li>Changing lines with <code>cc</code>.</li>
<li>Inserting text and exiting insert mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>You navigate this history using two primary commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Control-O:</strong>  Takes you back in the jump list (older locations). Think &ldquo;O&rdquo; for older.</li>
<li><strong>Control-I:</strong> Takes you forward in the jump list (newer locations). Think &ldquo;I&rdquo; for inwards (returning).  Mnemonic: Control-I is the opposite of Control-O.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<p>Imagine your cursor is on line 1. You then jump to line 50 using <code>50G</code>, then search for the word &ldquo;function&rdquo; using <code>/function</code>, and finally jump to the end of the file with <code>G</code>.</p>

<p>Now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pressing <code>Control-O</code> once takes you back to the end of the file (where you were after <code>G</code>).</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Control-O</code> again takes you back to the location of the word &ldquo;function&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Control-O</code> a third time takes you back to line 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you then want to retrace your steps forward:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pressing <code>Control-I</code> would take you back to the location of the word &ldquo;function&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Control-I</code> again would take you to the end of the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can repeatedly press <code>Control-O</code> or <code>Control-I</code> to navigate through your jump history. This allows for a very fluid workflow, enabling quick jumps between different parts of your file without having to manually re-navigate using line numbers or search patterns.  Itâ€™s especially powerful when combined with other Vim features, like marks.  You can set a mark with <code>ma</code> (where &lsquo;a&rsquo; is the name of the mark) and then jump back to it with &ldquo;a.  Combine this with jumps and you can create complex but easily repeatable navigation patterns.</p>

<p>While simple to use, Vim&rsquo;s jump list provides a powerful mechanism for navigating and revisiting locations in your code. Mastering its use will significantly enhance your editing efficiency.</p>
