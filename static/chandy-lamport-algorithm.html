<h1>Chandy-Lamport Algorithm</h1>
<br>
<div id="blog-content"><p>The Chandy-Lamport algorithm is a distributed snapshot algorithm used to record a consistent global state of a distributed system.  It&rsquo;s crucial for debugging, monitoring, and analyzing the system&rsquo;s behavior without stopping or significantly impacting its operation. This algorithm assumes that messages are delivered reliably and in FIFO order between any two processes in the system.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Initiation:</strong> A designated process, or any process needing a snapshot, initiates the process. This initiator process records its own local state and sends a special &ldquo;marker&rdquo; message along all its outgoing channels.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Marker Propagation:</strong> Upon receiving a marker message for the first time on a channel:</p>

<ul>
<li>The receiving process records its local state.</li>
<li>The receiving process records all subsequent messages received on that channel until it receives a marker message on that channel. These recorded messages are considered &ldquo;in-transit&rdquo; during the snapshot.</li>
<li>The receiving process then sends a marker message along all its outgoing channels.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Termination:</strong> The snapshot process concludes when every process has received a marker message on all its incoming channels.  Each process then sends its recorded local state and the collected &ldquo;in-transit&rdquo; messages to the initiator process.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Global State Assembly:</strong> The initiator process assembles the received local states and in-transit messages to construct a consistent global snapshot of the system.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine a system with three processes (P1, P2, P3). P1 initiates the snapshot.</p>

<pre><code>// Conceptual representation using JavaScript objects for state and messages

// Initial state
P1: { state: &quot;A&quot;, sent: [], received: [] }
P2: { state: &quot;B&quot;, sent: [], received: [] }
P3: { state: &quot;C&quot;, sent: [], received: [] }

// P1 initiates
P1.state = &quot;A1&quot;; // Record local state
P1.sent.push({ to: &quot;P2&quot;, marker: true }); // Send marker to P2
P1.sent.push({ to: &quot;P3&quot;, marker: true }); // Send marker to P3

// P2 receives marker from P1
P2.received.push({ from: &quot;P1&quot;, marker: true });
P2.state = &quot;B1&quot;;  // Record local state
P2.sent.push({ to: &quot;P1&quot;, msg: &quot;M1&quot; });  // Sends message M1 to P1 (after marker)
P2.sent.push({ to: &quot;P3&quot;, marker: true }); // Send marker to P3

// P3 receives marker from P1
P3.received.push({ from: &quot;P1&quot;, marker: true });
P3.state = &quot;C1&quot;; // Record local state
P3.sent.push({ to: &quot;P2&quot;, msg: &quot;M2&quot;}); // Sends message M2 to P2 (after marker)

// P1 receives M1 from P2 (after its own marker, so in-transit)
P1.received.push({ from: &quot;P2&quot;, msg: &quot;M1&quot;});

// P2 receives M2 from P3 (after its own marker to P3, but before receiving P3's marker, so in-transit for P3)

// P3 receives marker from P2
P3.received.push({ from: &quot;P2&quot;, marker: true });

// P2 receives marker from P3
P2.received.push({ from: &quot;P3&quot;, marker: true });

// P1 receives marker from P3
P1.received.push({ from: &quot;P3&quot;, marker: true });

// All processes have received markers on all channels.
// Snapshot consists of local states (A1, B1, C1) and in-transit messages (M1 for P1, M2 for P3).
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>FIFO Channels:</strong> The Chandy-Lamport algorithm relies on FIFO message delivery.  If messages can be reordered, the snapshot might not be consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity:</strong> The algorithm&rsquo;s complexity is relatively low, proportional to the number of channels in the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Chandy-Lamport algorithm provides a practical method for capturing consistent snapshots in distributed systems, enabling valuable insights into their behavior without disrupting normal operations.</p>
