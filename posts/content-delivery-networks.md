Title: Content Delivery Networks
Date: 21-Apr-2025

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content.  Instead of relying on a single origin server, a CDN replicates content across its multiple servers, placing it closer to end-users. This reduces latency and improves the user experience.

**How CDNs Work:**

1. **User Request:** When a user requests content (e.g., an image, video, or webpage), the request is routed to the nearest CDN server.

2. **Cache Hit/Miss:** The CDN server checks its cache for the requested content.
    - **Cache Hit:** If the content is cached, the CDN server delivers it directly to the user. This is the fastest scenario.
    - **Cache Miss:** If the content isn't cached, the CDN server retrieves it from the origin server, caches a copy, and then delivers it to the user. Subsequent requests for the same content will be served from the cache.

3. **Origin Server Relief:** By serving content from its cache, the CDN reduces the load on the origin server, preventing potential overload and improving the website's overall availability.

**Benefits of using a CDN:**

* **Reduced Latency:** Content is served from a server closer to the user, minimizing the distance data has to travel.
* **Improved Website Performance:** Faster content delivery leads to quicker page load times and a better user experience.
* **Increased Scalability:** CDNs can handle high traffic loads by distributing requests across multiple servers.
* **Enhanced Security:** Some CDNs offer security features like DDoS protection and SSL encryption.
* **SEO Benefits:** Faster page load times can positively impact search engine rankings.


**Example (Conceptual JavaScript):**

```javascript
// Imagine this code running on a CDN's edge server

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const cachedResponse = getFromCache(url.pathname);

  if (cachedResponse) {
    // Cache hit: serve from cache
    return new Response(cachedResponse, { status: 200 });
  } else {
    // Cache miss: fetch from origin and cache
    const response = await fetch("https://origin-server.com" + url.pathname);
    const content = await response.clone().text(); // or other appropriate method like arrayBuffer() for binary data.
    addToCache(url.pathname, content);
    return new Response(content, { status: response.status });
  }
}

// Simplified cache functions (in reality, these would be more robust)
const cache = new Map();
function getFromCache(key) { return cache.get(key); }
function addToCache(key, value) { cache.set(key, value); }

addEventListener('fetch', event => {
    event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})
```

This example demonstrates the basic logic of how a CDN edge server might handle requests, checking the cache and fetching from the origin if necessary.  Real-world CDN implementations are far more complex, handling various content types, cache invalidation strategies, and load balancing across multiple edge servers.
