Title: Vim Jumps
Date: 18-Apr-2025

Vim's jump list tracks your movements through a file, allowing you to quickly return to previously visited locations.  This is incredibly useful for navigating complex codebases or documents.

Think of the jump list as a breadcrumb trail of your editing journey. Every time you perform certain actions, Vim adds your current location to the list. These actions include:

* Using motions like `G`, `n`, `N`, `/`, `?`, `%`, `(`, `)`, `[[`, `]]`, `{`, `}`.
* Deleting lines with `dd`.
* Changing lines with `cc`.
* Inserting text and exiting insert mode.

You navigate this history using two primary commands:

* **Control-O:**  Takes you back in the jump list (older locations). Think "O" for older.
* **Control-I:** Takes you forward in the jump list (newer locations). Think "I" for inwards (returning).  Mnemonic: Control-I is the opposite of Control-O.

Here's an example:

Imagine your cursor is on line 1. You then jump to line 50 using `50G`, then search for the word "function" using `/function`, and finally jump to the end of the file with `G`.

Now:

* Pressing `Control-O` once takes you back to the end of the file (where you were after `G`).
* Pressing `Control-O` again takes you back to the location of the word "function".
* Pressing `Control-O` a third time takes you back to line 1.


If you then want to retrace your steps forward:

* Pressing `Control-I` would take you back to the location of the word "function".
* Pressing `Control-I` again would take you to the end of the file.

You can repeatedly press `Control-O` or `Control-I` to navigate through your jump history. This allows for a very fluid workflow, enabling quick jumps between different parts of your file without having to manually re-navigate using line numbers or search patterns.  Itâ€™s especially powerful when combined with other Vim features, like marks.  You can set a mark with `ma` (where 'a' is the name of the mark) and then jump back to it with ``a.  Combine this with jumps and you can create complex but easily repeatable navigation patterns.


While simple to use, Vim's jump list provides a powerful mechanism for navigating and revisiting locations in your code. Mastering its use will significantly enhance your editing efficiency.
