Title: Designing a URL Shortener
Date: 03-Jan-2025

A URL shortener, at its core, transforms a long URL into a shorter, more manageable one.  Think bit.ly or tinyurl.com.  When a user submits a long URL, the system generates a unique short code that redirects to the original URL when accessed.  This seemingly simple service presents interesting design challenges at scale.

Here's a breakdown of the key components:

**1. Hashing Algorithm:**

This is the heart of the system.  It converts a long URL into a short code.  A good hashing algorithm should be:

* **Collision-resistant:**  Minimize the chance of two different long URLs producing the same short code.
* **Reversible:**  Given a short code, the system should be able to retrieve the original long URL.
* **Short Code Generation:** Produce short codes that are compact and user-friendly.

Popular choices include MD5, SHA-256, or custom base-62 encoding.  A simple base-62 implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const BASE62 = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";

function shorten(longUrl, id) {
  let shortUrl = "";
  while (id > 0) {
    shortUrl = BASE62.charAt(id % 62) + shortUrl;
    id = Math.floor(id / 62);
  }
  return shortUrl;
}

// Example
console.log(shorten("https://www.example.com/very/long/url", 12345)); // Output: 3d7
```

**2. Storage:**

The system needs to store the mapping between short codes and long URLs.  Key-value stores like Redis are well-suited for this purpose due to their fast read and write speeds.  A relational database like PostgreSQL can also be used for more complex features like analytics.

**3. API Endpoint:**

The system needs an API endpoint to accept long URLs and return short codes.  This endpoint should handle:

* **URL Validation:** Ensure submitted URLs are valid.
* **Hashing:** Generate the short code.
* **Storage:** Save the mapping.
* **Response:** Return the short code to the user.

**4. Redirection Service:**

When a user accesses a short URL, the system should redirect them to the original long URL.  This involves:

* **Lookup:** Retrieve the original long URL based on the short code.
* **Redirection:** Send an HTTP redirect response to the user's browser.


**5. Optional Components:**

* **Custom Short URLs:**  Allowing users to choose their short codes.  Requires collision checking.
* **Analytics:** Tracking click-through rates, geographic location, etc.
* **Expiration:** Setting expiry dates for short URLs.

**Scalability Considerations:**

* **Database Sharding:** Distribute the data across multiple database servers to handle high traffic.
* **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed URLs to reduce database load.
* **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability.



This overview provides a starting point for designing a URL shortening service.  Remember to consider the specific requirements and constraints of your application when making design choices.
