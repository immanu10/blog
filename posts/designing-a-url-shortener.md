Title: Designing a URL Shortener
Date: 05-Jan-2025

A URL shortener, at its core, transforms long URLs into shorter, more manageable ones.  Think TinyURL or bit.ly.  Behind the scenes, it's a fascinating exercise in distributed systems design. Let's break down the key components.

**1. Hashing:**

The heart of a URL shortener is its hashing algorithm.  This algorithm takes an arbitrary input (the long URL) and outputs a fixed-length string. This short string becomes the "shortened" URL.  Several hashing algorithms are suitable, each with tradeoffs:

* **MD5/SHA-256:**  Cryptographic hashes, excellent for security and collision resistance, but produce longer outputs.  Not ideal for concise short URLs.
* **MurmurHash/FNV:** Non-cryptographic, optimized for speed and shorter outputs, but with a slightly higher collision risk.
* **Base62 encoding:**  Crucial for representing the hash as a readable string. It uses a-z, A-Z, and 0-9, allowing for a more compact representation than just hexadecimal.

Example in Go:

```go
import (
	"crypto/sha256"
	"encoding/base64"
	"fmt"
	"math/big"
)


func shortenURL(longURL string) string {
    hash := sha256.Sum256([]byte(longURL))
		//Base64 encode the hash
		encodedHash := base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(hash)
		//For Base 62 a custom implementation is required
		//For demonstration, simply taking a fixed number of characters
		shortURL := encodedHash[:8] //Take first 8 characters
		return shortURL
}


func main() {
	longURL := "https://www.example.com/very/long/url/path"
	shortURL := shortenURL(longURL)
	fmt.Println("Shortened URL:", shortURL)
}


```

**2. Storage:**

We need a persistent store to map short URLs back to their original counterparts.  Several options exist:

* **Key-Value Store (Redis, Memcached):**  Excellent for fast lookups, crucial for URL redirection.  Suitable for high read volumes.
* **Relational Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL):** Offers data integrity and ACID properties, helpful for analytics and managing URL metadata (e.g., creation date, click counts).

**3. Handling Collisions:**

Even with good hashing algorithms, collisions (where two long URLs produce the same short URL) are possible. Strategies for handling them include:

* **Append a counter/random characters:**  If a collision occurs, append a counter or random characters to the hash to make it unique.
* **Pre-generate short codes:** Avoid collisions entirely by pre-generating unique short codes and assigning them to long URLs as they come in.


**4. Scalability:**

* **Sharding:** Distribute the data across multiple servers to handle high traffic volumes. The short URL can be used to determine the appropriate shard.
* **Caching:** Employ caching mechanisms at various levels (CDN, server-side) to reduce database load.
* **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers handling lookups and redirects.

**5. Optional Features:**

* **Custom Short URLs:** Allow users to customize their short URLs.
* **Analytics:** Track click-through rates and other metrics.
* **Expiration:**  Set expiration dates for short URLs.

A URL shortener, while seemingly simple, involves a nuanced interplay of hashing, storage, and scalable system design. Understanding these concepts is key to crafting an efficient and robust solution.
