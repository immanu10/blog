Title: Designing a URL Shortener
Date: 03-Jan-2025

A URL shortener, at its core, transforms a long URL into a shorter, more manageable one.  Think bit.ly or tinyurl.com.  While seemingly simple, designing a robust URL shortener involves several interesting considerations.

**Core Components:**

1. **Hashing Algorithm:** This is the heart of the system.  It takes the long URL and generates a unique short code.  Popular choices include MD5, SHA-1, or custom base-62 encoding.  A crucial aspect is minimizing collisions (different long URLs producing the same short code).

   ```javascript
   function base62encode(num) {
       const chars = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
       let shortUrl = "";
       while (num > 0) {
           shortUrl = chars[num % 62] + shortUrl;
           num = Math.floor(num / 62);
       }
       return shortUrl;
   }

   // Example
   const longUrlHash = 1234567890; // Assume this is the output of a hashing function
   const shortCode = base62encode(longUrlHash);
   console.log(shortCode); // Output will be a base62 encoded string.
   ```

2. **Storage:**  We need to store the mapping between short codes and original URLs.  Key-value stores like Redis are excellent for fast lookups.  For larger scale, distributed databases might be necessary.  The storage schema could be as simple as:

   ```
   Key: shortCode
   Value: { originalUrl, creationDate, expirationDate, userId, ... }
   ```

3. **API Endpoint:**  This exposes the functionality.  A `POST /shorten` endpoint accepts the long URL and returns the shortened version.  A `GET /{shortCode}` endpoint redirects the user to the original URL.

   ```javascript
   // Example 'GET' endpoint logic (highly simplified)
   app.get('/:shortCode', (req, res) => {
       const shortCode = req.params.shortCode;
       // Retrieve original URL from the database based on shortCode
       db.get(shortCode, (err, originalUrl) => {
           if (err) {
               // Handle error
               return res.status(500).send('Error');
           }
           if (!originalUrl) {
               // Handle short code not found
               return res.status(404).send('Not Found');
           }
           res.redirect(originalUrl);
       });
   });
   ```

**Scalability Considerations:**

* **Distributed Cache:**  Caching frequently accessed URLs in a distributed cache like Memcached reduces database load.
* **Sharding:**  Distributing the data across multiple database servers allows horizontal scaling.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Preventing abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single IP address.
* **Custom Short Codes:**  Allowing users to customize their short codes (for a fee, perhaps).

**Further Enhancements:**

* Analytics:  Tracking click-through rates and other metrics.
* User Accounts:  Allowing users to manage their shortened URLs.

By carefully considering these components, we can design a URL shortener that is not only functional but also scalable and reliable.
