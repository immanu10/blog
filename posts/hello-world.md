Welcome to my blog site.

Learning Go for a while now and its been fun. So i decided to make something.

Simple SSG in Go 

Few things i want to achieve for this blog:

- [x] Take `.md` files and convert to `.html` files.

- [x] Serve generated html file and static asset using github-pages.

- [x] I'm a lazzy ass, and I suck at writing, so generate new blog using AI.

- [x] Try to use github actions to automate and set up a cron job to generate 1 blog per day and publish it.
